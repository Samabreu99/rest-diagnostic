#Question 1 
- REST is used to design web API's, you can create different routes in order for other 
developers to see your work without having to go deep into your code.

#Question 2
- POST '/movies'
GET '/movies'
GET '/movies/:id'
PATCH '/movies/:id'
DELETE '/movies/:id'

#Question 3
- It makes your code easier to read, the conventions do all the work for you so you dont have to worry about 
routes and i wouldnt recommend using REST if you need to make constant changes in your API.
